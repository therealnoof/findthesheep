# findthesheep
A set of simulation tools for a SSLO threat hunting lab.

findTheSheep is a network scanning tool that will scan a subnet and report back open ports and IP addresses and then dump that into a text file.

carePackage simulates a C2 server/application that calls home periodically and delivers some tasty nuggets.

purePWNage is a Ransomware simulation script. It will create a company secret file and then encrypt it. The key is then "hidden" and a ransom note is left for the student.
